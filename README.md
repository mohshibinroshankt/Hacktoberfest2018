# Hacktoberfest2018 ~ Week 2 Challenge
For previous challenges, please look at [readmes](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/Hacktoberfest2018/tree/master/READMES).

*This is part of a series of weekly projects that will be in this repository over the span of hacktoberfest.*
*this is satire, it's meant to be cute and to see what potential PRs have (both during hacktoberfest and otherwise)*

# Mini-Arcade
Raid and his hundreds of new friends are SOOOO Bored! They have ABSOLUTELY nothing to do, NOTHING!

# How can I help?!
Raid got an idea, his idea was that maybe... Just MAYBE... him and his new friends could work on some fun HTML5 games in the `Games` folder.

# HTML5 Games?
Yep. Pure HTML5, Only using three files, `index.html`, `main.css` and `main.js`
You can use ANY html, ANY js, and ANY css you want, as long as you don't create more files.
***The game can be as simple, or as complicated as you want it to be.***

# What are the rules?
1. Your submission must be in `/Games/YOURUSERNAME/`
2. You must submit ONLY FOUR files//comment , `index.html`, `main.css`, and `main.js`. Even if they are empty!
3. You must keep JS in `main.js`, CSS in `main.css` and HTML in `index.html`. Try to separate these aspects properly.
4. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, while loops that never end, CPU Monero Miners)
5. No NSFW (porn, nudes, pictures of your cat's testicles, severed heads)
6. No ADS (No advertising your product, No third party ads)
7. There must be some interactive element of your game. The user does something, the game reacts.
8. DO NOT MODIFY OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBMISSIONS. THESE PRS WILL BE INSTANTLY DENIED AND MARKED SPAM.

# External Resources!???
I know some of you may want to use external resources such as images, json files, anything like that...
Images (gifs,jpg,png) can go on IMGUR with no issues
Files (json,txt,csv) should go on either PASTEBIN or somewhere similar
Embedables (svg, base64 images) can simply be embedded in your file somewhere

# Final Note
Make your games fun, unique, and intuitive. There should not be some 50 page manual on how to play your game, and if there is, it should be embedded into the game.
